// Inheritance allows one class (child class) to inherit the 
//properties and methods of another class (parent class). 
//This promotes code reusability.

// Single Inheritance: A class inherits from one parent class.
// class A =====> class B

//Multilevel Inheritance: A class inherits from a child class, 
// which in turn inherits from another class.
// class A ====> class B ====> class C =====> D

//Multiple Inheritance A class can inherit from multiple 
//classes (JavaScript doesnâ€™t directly support this, but
// we can simulate it with mixins).
